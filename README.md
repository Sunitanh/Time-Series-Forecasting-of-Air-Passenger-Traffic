# Time-Series-Forecasting-of-Air-Passenger-Traffic
Objective: To develop an accurate time series forecasting model using ARIMA-based techniques to predict future air passenger volumes, enabling better resource planning and strategic decision-making for the aviation industry.
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn | Models: ARIMA, SARIMA | Metrics: RMSE, MAPE
•	Built a univariate time series forecasting model to predict monthly international air passenger traffic using ARIMA and SARIMA.
•	Performed data preprocessing, visualization, and seasonal decomposition to identify trends, seasonality, and stationarity.
•	Tuned model parameters (p, d, q) using ACF/PACF plots and AIC/BIC metrics to improve forecast accuracy.
•	Evaluated model performance using RMSE and MAPE; selected the best model for forecasting next 24 months.
•	Visualized forecast results along with 95% confidence intervals to interpret future passenger trends.
•	Enabled data-driven decision making for airline capacity planning and business strategy.
