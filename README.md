# Time-Series-Forecasting-of-Air-Passenger-Traffic
**Business Context:**
Airlines and aviation authorities require accurate forecasts of passenger traffic to plan resources, manage capacity, and make strategic decisions related to operations, staffing, and marketing. Understanding trends and seasonal patterns in air travel is critical to ensuring profitability and customer satisfaction. This project addresses that need by using statistical time series forecasting techniques to predict future air passenger volumes.
________________________________________
**Problem Statement:**
The aviation industry experiences cyclical trends due to seasonality, holidays, and economic factors. Relying on static year-over-year comparisons or intuition can lead to overstaffing, underutilization of resources, or missed opportunities. 

The objective is to:

• Build a robust and interpretable time series model (ARIMA/SARIMA)

• Forecast international air passenger traffic over the next 24 months

• Help stakeholders make data-driven planning and operational decisions
________________________________________
**Data Availability:**

The dataset used contains monthly international air passenger traffic data, typically formatted as:

    • Date (monthly intervals)

    • Passenger count

The dataset is univariate and publicly available from sources such as:

    • Kaggle's Air Passenger dataset (e.g., 1949–1960 monthly passengers)

    • UCI Repository or airline records
________________________________________
**Data Understanding:**

Initial exploratory analysis included:

• Time plot of passenger counts to detect trend and seasonality

• Stationarity check using ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) test

• Seasonal decomposition using additive/multiplicative models to isolate trend, seasonality, and residuals

• ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plots used to identify the order of AR and MA components

**Key Steps Performed:**

**1.Data Cleaning:**

    o Parsed date formats and set the index to a monthly datetime index
    
    o Handled any missing values or anomalies in the time series

**2.Visualization & Decomposition:**

    o Visualized seasonality and trend using rolling means and decomposition
    
    o Identified yearly patterns in passenger volume growth

**3.Model Development:**
    
    o Built and tuned ARIMA and SARIMA models
   
    o Used grid search and AIC/BIC to select optimal (p, d, q) and seasonal parameters (P, D, Q, s)

**4.Forecasting:**
    
    o Generated forecasts for the next 24 months
    
    o Plotted forecast with confidence intervals for uncertainty estimation

**5.Model Evaluation:**

    o Assessed prediction performance using:

      1.RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
      
      2.MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

**Challenges & Learnings:**

**Challenges:**

• Making the time series stationary via differencing without overfitting

• Selecting optimal model parameters while balancing model complexity and interpretability

• Accounting for seasonality and trend shifts in post-pandemic or irregular periods
